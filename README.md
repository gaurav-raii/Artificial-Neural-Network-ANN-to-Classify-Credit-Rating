# Artificial-Neural-Network-ANN-to-Classify-Credit-Rating
This Project aims at classifying the credit rating of a customer as good or bad using 20 attributes.
An Artificial Feed Forward Neural Network was used to classify the observations.
One hot encoding was used to encode all the nominal attributes.
Different configuration of Network layers such as (3),(11),(5,4),(6,5),(7,6),(8,7) were used and Cross validation was used to determine the best configuration
Final model was trained using the configuration selected through cross validation.
